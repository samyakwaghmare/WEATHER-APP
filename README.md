# WEATHER-APP
 I have created a web application with JavaScript (Vanilla JavaScript: No Framework).
functional Weather App.
our weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API , an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (18Â°C) in Celsius unit, the weather description (clear sky), and then the user's city and country .
When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
The API provider is http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org
